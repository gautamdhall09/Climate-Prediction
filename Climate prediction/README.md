# Weather_forecast

The Project is done in 3 parts. The Complexity & performance of the model increases from starting to the end.
</br>
</br>1. In w_one folder, Applied Linear Regression with OLS for temperature prediction (Dataset is already present inside folder).
</br>
</br>
2. In w_two folder, Applied Linear Regression with Regularization(Elastic Net) for rainfall prediction (Dataset is already present inside folder).
</br>
</br>
3. In w_three folder, Applied RNN(LSTM) for pressure, windspeed, & temperature prediction (Dataset is already present inside folder).
